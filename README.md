# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

The project was built using Create React App.

Future plans to improve the application include introducing responsive design and updating the Weather Card based on local weather conditions.
