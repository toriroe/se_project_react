# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

This version of the project connects the WTWR front end to the back-end (the link to the repo can be found at the bottom of the page).

Additionally, this most recent iteration of the CRA project implements user authorization and authentication - users are able to create an account and log in. Users are able to upload, like, and delete their own clothing items, as well as view and like clothing items from other users that are stored in the database. Authorized users are able to like clothing items, as well as view their own profile page where they can see a list of their own clothing items and update their name or avatar image.

Future plans to improve the application include introducing responsive design and updating the Weather Card based on local weather conditions.
